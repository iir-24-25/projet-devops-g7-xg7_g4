# Splash Screen Instructions

The app requires a proper splash screen at `assets/images/splash.png` with the following specifications:
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Content: The PharmaFlow logo centered on a light background

## How to Create a Splash Screen

1. Use the splash generator tool at `assets/temp/splash-generator.html`
2. Create a proper design using a tool like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Photoshop
3. Export as a 1024x1024 PNG file
4. Place in `assets/images/splash.png`

The current splash.png is a temporary placeholder and should be replaced with a professional design before production.
